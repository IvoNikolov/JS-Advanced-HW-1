There ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
Ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna get up out of the ground
Ain't no grave gonna hold my body down

Go down yonder Gabriel put your foot on the land and sea
Oh Gabriel don't you blow your trumpet until you hear from me

I looked way over yonder and what do you think I see?
I see a band of angels and they're coming after me

Then I looked way down the river saw the people dressed in white
I knew it was God's people 'cause I saw them doing right

Ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
Ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna get up out of the ground
Ain't no grave gonna hold my body down

I'm going down to the river Jordan and I'm gonna bury my knees in the sand
Holler "Ah, hosanna" till I reach the promised land

Then I looked way over yonder and what do you think I see?
I see a band of angels and they're coming after me

So meet me King Jesus meet me won't you meet me in the middle of the air
If these wings should carry me, I won't need another pair

Ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
Ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
When I hear that trumpet sound I'm gonna get up out of the ground
Ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
Ain't no grave gonna hold my body down
